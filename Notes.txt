Summary: The goal of this project was to extend the idea from journalV1 where many issues where present such as redundant code and lack of organization. In the second version, a better organization in the project was made which lead to less redundant code present trough out the project. While the goal was to reduce the repetition of code to a point where it not noticeable, the issue arose again. This was due to lack of pre-planning, time was spent in planning & designing UI component trough out every page but no actual time was spend in planning and designing how each page, functions, code would actually interact with each other which at times I was able to notice how I would write the same function again with a small change in the structure. The project deadline was extended over a month of the original goal which was due to employment, while not an excuse it did consume large amount of time. I have decided to scrap the project and move on to a different project. The project has not been completely scrapped from my project list, I will return to this project in the future with a better implementation and build it using React rather then raw html, CSS, JS code.
